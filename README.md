# mkBot

A multipurpose IRC bot. Catered towards members of the [KittensGame](https://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/) chatroom community, which in turn is part of the [Canternet IRC Network](https://canternet.org/).

This is a personal project that's been slowly evolving since September 2020. Starting with no Python experience, it's been a rewarding challenge to figure everything out as I go along. :) 

I started learning Python properly more recently, so I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to rewrite the bot from the ground up! I'm cataloguing the fruits of my labour here as I bring it back to base functionality and beyond.

## Operation

To protect my privacy, I haven't uploaded my own configuration files for connecting to servers and APIs, as this repository is more for creating a personal record than producing something for others to use. These files are required for it to run.

I'll probably add example files in the future, but for now, it's not necessary.
